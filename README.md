# REPLICA PROJECT

To close the end of my two months of training at Le Reacteur, I had to create replica of the site of my choice. My choice was the videogames website: RAWG.io
It offers interesting features such as creating an account, searching games, writing comments and more.

# MY RAWG FEATURES

* Search a game
* Infinite scroll (no pagination)
* Create an account
* Log in (if you have an account)
* Add a game in your Favorites
* Delete a game from your Favorites
* Add a game in your Wishlist
* Delete a game from your Wishlist
* Write a comment in a game page
* View all your comments in your Review page
* Delete a comment

# IN PROGRESS

I need to improve few things at the moment
- Responsive mobile 
- Creation safety (No space allowed in username and confirm mail)
- Autoupdate for pages following a chronology (THIS WEEK, NEXT WEEK, LAST 30 DAYS, etc)

# TOOLS

I create this website with React.js
NPM Packages : 
- Axios 
- JS-Cookie
- Bottom Scroll listener
- Responsive Carousel
- fontawesome
